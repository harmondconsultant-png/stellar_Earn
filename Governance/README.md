# Governance

This folder holds the project's **governance documentation** for StellarEarn — how
decisions are made, who is responsible for what, and the policies that keep the
project healthy, secure, and sustainable.

It is intentionally kept separate from the codebase: nothing here changes
application behaviour. Each document below is added and refined through small,
independently-reviewable pull requests (tracked as governance issues), and every
governance change is limited to files inside this `Governance/` folder.

## Structure

- **Charter & principles** — mission, scope, guiding values, and how this
  governance itself is amended.
- **Security disclosure template** - [templates/DISCLOSURE_TEMPLATE.md](templates/DISCLOSURE_TEMPLATE.md)
  is the private form for reporting a security vulnerability.
- **Working groups and SIGs** - [WORKING_GROUPS.md](WORKING_GROUPS.md)
  defines how groups are formed, report to the TSC, and dissolve.
- **Postmortem template** - [templates/POSTMORTEM_TEMPLATE.md](templates/POSTMORTEM_TEMPLATE.md)
  is the blameless template for writing incident postmortems.
- **RFC template** - [templates/RFC_TEMPLATE.md](templates/RFC_TEMPLATE.md) is
  the reusable template for writing RFC proposals, with a status field.
- **Subproject acceptance** - [SUBPROJECT_ACCEPTANCE.md](SUBPROJECT_ACCEPTANCE.md)
  defines how new subprojects are proposed, incubated, and accepted.
- **Maintainers roster** - [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md) lists current
  maintainers, their areas, and how the roster is updated.
- **Maintainer offboarding** - [OFFBOARDING.md](OFFBOARDING.md) defines how a
  maintainer steps down or is removed, access revocation, and emeritus status.
- **Roles** — maintainers, reviewers, triagers, security team, release managers,
  and how people move between them.
- **Decision-making** — [DECISION_MAKING.md](DECISION_MAKING.md): lazy
  consensus, escalation, and what triggers a formal vote; see also
  [VOTING.md](VOTING.md), quorum, RFCs, tie-breaking, and how decisions are
  recorded.
- **Contribution & review** — review policy, approvals, triage, merge and commit
  policies, and the contribution ladder.
- **Community** — Code of Conduct, enforcement, communication norms, and safety.
- **Technical policies** — release/versioning, deprecation, dependencies, CI/CD,
  testing, contract-upgrade governance, and audits.
- **Security & compliance** — disclosure, incident response, secrets, access
  control, and data governance.
- **Finance** — treasury, grants, sponsorship, and transparency reporting.
- **Sponsorship acceptance** — [SPONSORSHIP.md](SPONSORSHIP.md) defines criteria, disclosure, and process for accepting sponsorships.
- **Grant application & disbursement** — [GRANTS.md](GRANTS.md) defines the grant application process, review criteria, and milestone-based disbursement.
- **Records & templates** — decision logs, meeting minutes, ADRs, and reusable
  templates.
- **Architecture Decision Records** - [decisions/README.md](decisions/README.md)
  contains the ADR index and numbering scheme for architectural decisions.
- **Archival Policy** — [ARCHIVE_POLICY.md](ARCHIVE_POLICY.md) defines how superseded
  documents are archived and stored.
